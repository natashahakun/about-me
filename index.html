    <h1>Where I’m From</h1>
    <p>Orignially from a suburb of Philadelphia, I lived in Tampa, FL for six years before moving to Richmond. I love the seasons, especially the fall, and being so close to the beach and the mountains, although I am definitely an urbanite at heart. My favorite things about Richmond are its beautiful architecture, bike-friendliness, and welcoming people!</p>

    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
    <p>I love being active. Yoga, swimming, walking, biking! The downtown Y is an awesome place to hang out. I also love exploring new places in the city and eating delicious food (especially if it's prepared by someone else!).</p>
    <h2>What’s your dream job?</h2>
    <p>Being on a team with creative and engaging people working on projects that make a difference.</p>
    <h2>What’s your background?</h2>
    <p>Prior to learning web development, I was a teacher for three years and I've been a tutor and freelance editor for several years. My education background has helped me to grasp the importance of conceptual understanding and that has been a cornerstone in my process of learning web development.</p>
    <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
    <p>The head and the heart!</p>
