    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I’m a Front End who loves good design, good coffee, and good people. I work as a Front-End Development and iOS mentor for Thinkful, a web developer for IdeaBase, and a freelance iOS developer.</p>
    <p>I love the web and all the awesome things that come out of it. I’m excited to live and work in a time of huge advances in web technology. It’s easier than ever to share and collaborate with others, all because of the Internet.</p>
    <p>Education is also super important to me - I come from a family of educators - and I’m stoked to work with Thinkful’s awesome student community.</p>

    <h1>Where I’m From</h1>
    <p>I’m from the Midwest - Ohio, specifically - Cleveland, even more specifically. I love the spacious fields, the smell of the outdoors, and the people in Ohio. I bring a bit of the Midwest work ethic to all my projects - a craftsman’s approach to Doing Things Right the First Time.</p>
    <p>I’m finishing my design degree at Kent State University, and will be graduating this winter with a focus in interaction design.</p>
